# use podman instead
it's a drop-in replacement and it doesn't require docker desktop (nice for WSL)

# docker? i barely even know her

`docker run ubuntu` will automatically install an ubuntu image
...however this will not do much since the container automatically stops or
something.

`docker run -it ubuntu` will run in "interactive mode," keeping it running.

you'll need to do `apt update` because the default apt list is VERY short.

if you just want to install an image without running it, do
`docker search <name>` to find the one you want, then do `docker pull <name>`

`docker image ls` lists installed images (duh)

# why are my colors broken? ðŸ˜ 

use -e to set an environment variable from the command line

- docker run -it -e "TERM=xterm-256color" ubuntu
- PS1='\\e\[92m\\u\\e\[0m@\\e\[94m\\h\\e\[0m:\\e\[35m\\w\\e\[0m '
  alternatively, you can use a dockerfile

```Dockerfile
FROM ubuntu
ENV TERM=xterm-256color
RUN echo "PS1='\e[92m\u\e[0m@\e[94m\h\e[0m:\e[35m\w\e[0m '" >> /root/.bashrc
```

# alpine notes

- alpine uses the `apk` package manager
- the shell is busybox ash, not bash.
  busybox is a lightweight GNU coreutils alternative.

# leave a container without stopping
ctrl+p ctrl+q

# reattach to a stopped container

accidentally leave your container? it hasn't disappeared; it just stopped.

- `docker ps -a` gives you names of existing containers (`-as` also shows size)
- `docker start <name>`
- `docker attach <name>`

you can also rename containers if you don't like the autogenerated names with
`docker rename <oldname> <newname>`

# why can't my container access the internet?
`<docker|podman> run -it --network=host <image>`
