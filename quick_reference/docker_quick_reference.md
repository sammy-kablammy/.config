# docker? i barely even know her

`docker run ubuntu` will automatically install an ubuntu image
...however this will not do much since the container automatically stops or
something.

`docker run -it ubuntu` will run in "interactive mode," keeping it running.

you'll need to do `apt update` because the default apt list is VERY short.

# alpine notes

- alpine uses the `apk` package manager
- the shell is busybox ash, not bash.
  busybox is a lightweight GNU coreutils alternative.

# reattach to a stopped container

accidentally leave your container? it hasn't disappeared; it just stopped.

- `docker ps -a` gives you names of existing containers (`-as` also shows size)
- `docker start <name>`
- `docker attach <name>`

you can also rename containers if you don't like the autogenerated names with
`docker rename <oldname> <newname>`
